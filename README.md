# Pinkalculator

Pinkalculator is a simple calculator made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. What makes it different from the million other JavaScript calculators in the market? Well, it's pink. What else could you want?

It can do the following operations: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and modulo. Although it works by comparing two numbers only (meaning that it doesn't follow PEMDAS), it does support decimals and negative values!

You can perform longer operations by continuing to press the operation buttons. Doing so will show you the answer to the previous operation before letting you continue with the new number (if this sounds a bit confusing, try typing 2 + 2 + 2. After typing the second plus sign, you'll see the result of the first operation, which is 4).

Finally, the fabulous Pinkalculator has full keyboard integration!
* Typing in any number from 0 to 9 works the same way as clicking the number buttons on the calculator
* Typing in any symbol (for operations supported by the calculator) also does the same as clicking its respective button
* Pressing Backspace will do the same as the AC button, resetting the calculator
* Pressing Enter will do the same as the = button

And that's all! I hope you enjoy solving pretty math! <3
